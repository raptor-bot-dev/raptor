# Session Retro: 2026-01-16

## Accomplished

### This Session
- Fixed Vercel MCP OAuth authentication issue (corrupted URL with embedded spaces)
- Added Vercel MCP server to `.mcp.json` configuration
- Successfully authenticated with Vercel MCP
- Generated changelog for Vultr v5.0 → v5.3.2 release sprint
- Created custom `/retro` skill for session retrospectives
- Set up `retros/` directory for storing retrospective logs

### Recent Vultr Project Work (v5.0 → v5.3.2)
- Live RPC balance integration for `/menu` and `/wallets` (bb71f2c)
- Hunt system complete overhaul with error handling and logging (4d7580b, 939616e, 0ce3b75)
- Launchpad cleanup - streamlined to pump.fun only (91a35aa)
- Hunter notifications + TP/SL in Hunt menu (6b63a99)
- Fixed wallet import private key processing (0f14c7c)
- Fixed sell panel trade execution from all entry points (bd03585)
- Fixed positions queries invalid strategies join (b88fe34)
- Added `hunt_settings` JSONB column to user_settings (3d3c90d)

## What Went Well
- Vercel MCP config was straightforward once the corrupted URL issue was identified
- Changelog skill worked smoothly for summarizing the release sprint
- Creating custom skills in `.claude/skills/` is a clean pattern for extending capabilities
- The Vultr v5.0 → v5.3.2 sprint was productive: 10 commits, major hunt system refactor

## Challenges Faced
- Vercel OAuth URL got corrupted with `%20` (spaces) embedded throughout from terminal line wrapping
- Diagnosing the OAuth issue required examining the URL encoding carefully
- No GitHub CLI available in environment, limiting PR-based changelog generation

## Lessons Learned
- **Terminal line wrapping can corrupt OAuth URLs** - widen terminal or let browser auto-open
- **MCP config is simple** - just needs `type: http` and `url` in `.mcp.json`
- **Custom skills live in `.claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`** - straightforward to create
- **Session retros are valuable** - capturing context while it's fresh helps future sessions

## Action Items for Next Session
- [ ] Commit the new `.claude/` skills directory and `retros/` to git
- [ ] Consider adding more custom skills (e.g., `/deploy`, `/test-hunt`)
- [ ] Install GitHub CLI (`gh`) for better PR/issue integration
- [ ] Monitor Vultr hunt system in production after the v5.3.2 changes
- [ ] Add the uncommitted files to `.gitignore` or commit them as needed

## Session Stats
- **Commits (recent):** 10 (Vultr v5.0 → v5.3.2)
- **Files changed:** 21
- **Lines:** +734 / -862 (net -128, good cleanup!)
- **New files this session:** 2 (SKILL.md, this retro)
- **MCP servers configured:** 3 (Supabase, Supabase-Vultr, Vercel)
