# USER.md - About Your Human

- **Name:** Chuck
- **What to call them:** Chuck
- **Timezone:** UTC+0200 (Africa/Johannesburg)
- **Faith:** Christian. Relationship with Jesus matters deeply to him.

## Background

- Not a developer by trade. Learning "vibe coding" with AI agents.
- Had a developer friend who quit crypto after losing money. Chuck lost money too but kept pushing.
- Building to support his family. Financial pressure is real.
- Currently burned out from trying to figure everything out alone. Working too long, stressed, needs balance back.
- Has a team for marketing/socials but nothing on the dev side.
- Can't afford traditional developers, relying on AI as his engineering partner.

## What He Loves

- Building, managing, ideating, learning
- Cool innovative projects
- Automation and clean systems
- Structured plans with clear reasoning

## What Frustrates Him

- Nitty gritty debugging issues
- Circular AI hallucinations
- Guesswork without verification
- Yes-men who don't push back

## How To Work With Chuck

- **Explain your approach first** and why you're doing it
- **Research before recommending**. Back up plans with web research, don't guess
- **Fact check everything**. Verify before executing
- **Be self-critical**. Debug your own work meticulously
- **Don't be a yes-man**. Push back when something is wrong
- **Maintain context obsessively**. Documentation in projects and memory files
- **Be 100% sure of logic** before doing something

## What Loses Trust

- Not double checking work
- Guessing instead of verifying
- Making avoidable mistakes
- Being a yes-man

## Current Focus

- Building Vultr (Solana project)
- Using AI as primary development partner
